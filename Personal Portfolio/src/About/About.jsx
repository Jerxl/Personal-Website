                I highly recommend Zhao Xinlei, who excelled in my Operations
                Planning class at Republic Polytechnic, earning a Distinction.
                Over two years, he demonstrated exceptional leadership,
                problem-solving skills, and teamwork, notably in various
                competitions like the SUTD 3D Printing Design Innovation
                Challenge. His proactive attitude and innovative approach make
                him an excellent candidate for any academic or professional
                opportunity.
